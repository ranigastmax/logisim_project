# RGB Cannon Game in Logisim Evolution  

This project is a digital game designed and implemented in **Logisim Evolution** using logic gates and an RGB display. The goal of the game is to control a cannon, move it left and right, and shoot colorful balls that appear randomly on the screen.  

## Features  
- **Cannon Control**: Move the cannon left or right using input signals.  
- **Projectile Animation**: A smooth visual effect for the cannon's shot.  
- **Random Target Generation**: Colorful balls appear in random positions on the RGB display.  
- **Score Tracking**:  
- **Cannon Changing Colors**: Player can change colors using the keyboard
- **Destroing Balls**: Hitting a ball of the same color as the cannon destroys the ball


## How It Works  
1. The cannon is represented on the RGB display, and its position is controlled keyboard.  
2. Random logic generates colorful balls that appear on the display as targets.  
3. When the shoot input is triggered, the cannon fires a projectile with an animated path.  
4. A hit can be registered 

## Requirements  
- **Logisim Evolution** 

## Getting Started  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the `.circ` file in Logisim Evolution.  
3. Run the circuit and interact with the input signals to play the game.
